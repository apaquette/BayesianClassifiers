# Machine Learning Notebook
### by Alex Paquette

This repository is a collection of notebooks showcasing my learning process through different Machine Learning and Neural Network algorithms. Each notebook features a different method and walks the reader through the CRISP-DM process. I've included each Machine Learning algorithm below, including the sources used to write the notebook, and the original datasets used.

## 1. Bayesian Classifiers

[Naive Bayes Classifier in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashant111/naive-bayes-classifier-in-python)

[Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/differentiated-thyroid-cancer-recurrence)


A live deployment of the model is available [here](https://bayesianclassifiers-apaquette.streamlit.app/)


## 2. Support Vector Machine
